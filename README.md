# HousePricePrediction
Predicts house sale prices using Python and linear regression, with data cleaning, visualization, and feature analysis to demonstrate end-to-end data science workflow

House Price Prediction

A data science project predicting house sale prices using real-world housing data. Demonstrates end-to-end workflow from data analysis to predictive modeling.

Overview

Goal: Predict house sale prices from key property features.

Skills showcased: Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature selection, regression modeling, and result evaluation.

Outcome: A working predictive model with visual insights into how features like living area, overall quality, and garage size influence sale price.

What I Did

Data Analysis: Explored trends using scatter plots and correlation heatmaps.

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and ensured data consistency.

Modeling: Built a linear regression model to predict sale prices.

Evaluation: Compared predicted vs actual values to measure performance.

Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

Impact

This project demonstrates my ability to:

Work with real datasets and clean/preprocess data.

Perform exploratory analysis to identify key factors.

Build and evaluate a predictive model to generate actionable insights.
